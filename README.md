# Final Project

For this project I made a shopping list. 


## Requirements

* **The distinct "features" I have in my project are:**
  * The ability to add different stores that you want to go shopping.
  * Under each store, being able to add different items for that specific store.
  * Single click changes the color as if you're checking it of the list.
  * Double click removes the item from the stores list.
  * A remove button at the bottom that clears out the entire list of stores and items.

* You're currently reading my `README.md` file that explains what my project is and how to use it.

* My project is hosted on GitHub pages.

* My code is clean:
  * Proper indentation
  * No unnecessary repetition
  * Variables as camelCase


## Future Plans

* I'd like to make a user sign-in so people can have an account to keep their shopping lists for future use

* I'd also like a place to add the price of items while you're shopping so you can compare them with future lists. Will help you save money in the future.

* Lastly, I'd like to turn this into a mobile app to make it easier to work with when you're at the store.
